## Commands

These are the current accepted commands. As the bot is still in development, some of these might be a little fucked, but they should (in theory) work as intended.
The command itself is the one with the `!` in front of it, while any other parameters is described inside the `<>`. Happy dying!

1. Clone the project with the following command, or fork your own: <br>
```git clone https://github.com/Angstboksen/RythmPlaylist.git``` <br>

2. After cloning. Be sure to have *npm* installed. . Install the needed dependencies with either of the following command(s):  <br>
```npm i``` ```npm install```

3. If you want to run your bot, make sure to change the values of the environment variables located in *.env_setup* to match your values. After that is done, rename the file to *.env*

4. Run the bot with the following command: <br>
```npm start```<br>
This will automatically make your bot online in discord
